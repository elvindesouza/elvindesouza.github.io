# [SQL Injection](src/security/AppSec/OWASP10/injection.md)

> SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data belonging to other users, or any other data that the application itself is able to access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior.

## [Secure Coding with Python](src/security/AppSec/secure_coding_python.md)

Tools and guidelines to follow when developing projects in Python, to make them less vulnerable and insecure, ensuring high quality and robust Python code

Covers codestyle, module structure guidelines, security tools to check python code, tests with Python, formatters and standardization, and type hinting along with type checking to scan for issues.

## [Static Code Analysis](src/security/AppSec/static_analysis.md)

Static Code Analysis (also known as Source Code Analysis) is usually performed as part of a Code Review (also known as white-box testing) and is carried out at the Implementation phase of a Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)

## [Dynamic Code Analysis](src/security/AppSec/dynamic_analysis.md)

Dynamic code analysis involves running code and examining the outcome, which also entails testing possible execution paths of the code.
