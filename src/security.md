## [Small Network Hardening](https://elvindsouza.github.io/hardening)

Hardened a small network by installing network security measures, and setting them up keeping in mind the services available on the network. Removed unnecessary services and applications, and audited user and service accounts on the systems. Reserved IP addresses manually, set up whitelists, and made other configurations to make the network more secure.

## [Small Network Penetration Testing](https://elvindsouza.github.io/NetworkPenetrationTesting)

Conducting a Network Penetration Test on a Small Network. Followed all the standard steps of a penetration test in accordance with applicable standards and guidelines, and documented the process.

## [GnuPG](gnupg.md)

The [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) implementation of the OpenPGP standard. File and message encryption with GnuPG. Different types of encryption-symmetric and asymmetric, along with [GPG-GUI](https://elvindsouza.github.io/GPG-GUI/), a front-end to GnuPG written in Python

## [netstat](netstat_linux.html)

Exploring netstat, and how we could use this as a diagnostic tool when troubleshooting or monitoring networks

## [hping3](hping3.html)

Setting up a DoS attack on a system or network, and experimenting with additional modes with hping

## [traceroute](traceroute.html)

Using the traceroute utility to inspect the route of a packet sent across networks. Additionally, covers how we could use this as a diagnostic tool

## [kexec and the scope of a physical attack](kexec.md)

Using the kexec Linux system call to load a kernel of your choice, and perform an attack in a more familiar environment
