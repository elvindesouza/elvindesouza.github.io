## [To design and configure a firewall on a server](firewall/firewall.md)

To design and configure a firewall on a server using Cisco Packet Tracer. Also involves testing correct configuration/ruleset. 

## [Designing and configuring a DHCP server using Cisco Packet Tracer](dhcp-server/dhcp-server.md)

We will be using Cisco Packet Tracer to create a network topology map consisting of a few PCs, and a server system to act as a DHCP server

## [Studying Linux and Windows network commands](commandline-networking-tools-linux-windows/commandline-networking-tools.md)

Taking a look at Linux and Windows network commands. [ping, pathping, ipconfig/ifconfig, arp, netstat, nbtstat, nslookup, route, traceroute/tracert, nmap, etc]

## [Creating a network topology map using Cisco Packet Tracer](topologymap/topology.md)

Setting up a small network of a few network and end devices using Hubs/Switches. It includes configuring LAN Cards, interfaces, preparation of cables, assigning IP addresses, and checking the connection of the network, all done in Cisco packet tracer, a network topology mapper.

## [Networking Basics](networking_basix.md)

Routers(and setup), switches, identifying devices on a local network, troubleshooting, ICMP, using the `ping` utility

The OSI and TCP/IP Models, packet capture with Wireshark

## [IP addressing](ip_addressing.md)

IP addresses-public and private, LAN, subnetting, DHCP servers

MAC addresses, ARP and ARP spoofing

## [DNS, nslookup, DNSSEC and OCSP](dns.md)

Exploring the Domain Name System, using `nslookup`, DNS cache poisoning, DNSSEC and OCSP stapling

## [How the Web Works, HTTP Request/Response Cycle](web.md)

HTTP/HTTPS-methods, status codes, URLs, tracking a GET request and the response

Also talking briefly about HTTP headers, and session keys, cookies

## [netstat](netstat_linux.html)

Exploring netstat, and how we could use this as a diagnostic tool when troubleshooting or monitoring networks

## [hping3](hping3.html)

Setting up a DoS attack on a system or network, and experimenting with additional modes with hping

## [traceroute](traceroute.html)

Using the traceroute utility to inspect the route of a packet sent across networks. Additionally, covers how we could use this as a diagnostic tool

## [DHCP](dhcp.md)
