# DHCP

**NOTES**

1. DHCP for ipv4 service automates assignment of IPv4 addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and other IPv4 networking parameters
2. When a host connects to the network, the DHCP server is contacted, and an address is required. The DHCP server chooses an address from a configured range of addresses called a pool and assigns(leases) it to the host
