Problem with the design/architecture causes a vulnerability.

Solution involves multiple stakeholders. Insecure design has implications across all the software development phases.

# Threat Modeling

Talked about in depth [here](../threat_modeling.md)
*accounting for everything that can go wrong, and then implementing a plan*

## Models
- STRIDE
- PASTA
- TRIKE
- VAST
- DREAD
- OCTAVE

Talked about in depth [here](../threat_modeling.md#stride)

## STRIDE
- spoofing
- tampering
- repudiation
- information disclosure
- denial of service
- elevation of privilege
