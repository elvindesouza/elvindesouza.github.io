*The "Multi-modal Human-machine Interface with AI" project aims to develop such new interfaces with AI. In order to solve the data protection problems, novel onion routing methods are being researched to obscure the metadata and thus ensure maximum data protection. This project will further investigate some of the issues with Tor, particularly how end-to-end congestion control techniques affect the speed of onion routing.*

- Investigating the implications of the cross-circuit interference (CCI) problem in the latest version of the Tor client, which includes end-to-end congestion control integration
- Comparing various proposed solutions to mitigate the CCI problem in Shadow.

Work performed under Prof. Dr. Florian Adamsky and professionally supervised by Mr. Sebastian Pahl.
