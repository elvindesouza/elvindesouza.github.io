# Surfing:

## [ungoogled chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium)

A very familiar experience for those familiar with Google Chrome

with basic security+privacy controls like-javascript disabled, cookies disabled, HTTPS-only(warning), location-camera-mic-audio-notification prompts blocked

toggle these controls if a site becomes unusable

background tasks _OFF_

Continue running background apps when Chromium is closed _OFF_

Disabling images is optional, and can completely break many websites
