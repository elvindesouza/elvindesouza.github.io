# Passwords/Secrets Management

## [Keepass](https://keepass.info/)/[KeepassX](https://www.keepassx.org/)/[KeepassXC](https://keepassxc.org/).

You may keep the database synced between devices and have randomized passwords for almost every account you have.

_The disadvantage of [GNU Pass](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pass) is that it clearly shows what services you have accounts on, while KeePass follows the container style that I prefer for password managers(unlock once, see all), though it is less extensible._

KeePassXC makes it incredibly easy to make all usernames-passwords-notes visible, see creation and last modification dates and has a password generator, showing entropy.

You can weed out weak or expired passwords and it comes with a random password generator.

A KeePassXC app is available on Android too, from the F-Droid store, with a decent featureset.

QtPass is a GUI for Pass.
