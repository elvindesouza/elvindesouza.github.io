    <h1><span style="color: white;">Kubuntu<br>
      </span></h1>
    <p><span style="color: white;">Kubuntu combines KDE's great desktop with
        ubuntu's software repos. Ubuntu comes with a lot of things
        pre-configured(somehow not TLP on laptops? no clue why) and is great for
        new linux users. It is stable, and I like it. Comes way too bloated OOTB
        though.<br>
      </span></p>
    <p><span style="color: white;">I use a KWin rule to hide all titlebars and
        using <a href="https://github.com/esjeon/krohnkite" target="_blank">Krohnkite</a>(newer,
        maintained fork <a href="https://github.com/Bismuth-Forge/bismuth" target="_blank">Bismuth</a>)
        to automatically tile leaves you with a tiling window manager, that you
        can disable when you need to. Most things just werk, and it is reliable<br>
      </span></p>
    <h1><span style="color: white;">Archlinux/Blackarch<br>
      </span></h1>
    <p><span style="color: white;">Archlinux gives you the power to tweak the
        system as you wish. You must set up EVERYTHING. It IS a timesink OS. No
        doubt about it.&nbsp; The control does leave you with something
        rewarding-a system you know every nook and cranny of. If anything goes
        wrong-you know how to fix it. It is a great distribution for those who
        want to get deeper into Linux. The archlinux installation I have is very
        small in disk footprint, has almost no software, and I use it when I'm
        not on wallpower, consuming 7-9W(very good for a ""gaming"" laptop!)<br>
      </span></p>
    <p><span style="color: white;">For security tools, I use blackarch linux,
        basically Archlinux with the blackarch repos. Theres <em>thousands&nbsp;
          </em>of tools available. Of course you aren't going to use them all,
        but it is really nice to have all the important tools already present on
        your system. For some weird reason the "Slim" edition ISO does not have
        the TWM configurations, instead you are made to use the xfce environment
        with their tacky theming. You can curl/git clone the configs from their
        github.</span></p>
