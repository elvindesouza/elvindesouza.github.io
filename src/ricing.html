        risk levels</span></h1>
    <p style="background-color: black;"><span style="color: white;">A)
        Sandboxed(Virtual-Machine)</span></p>
    <p style="background-color: black;"><span style="color: white;">you are free
        to tinker with anything you want. Experimenting and tinkering here is
        typically safe and the risks only deal with how the sandbox might
        unknowingly affect hardware outside of the sandbox. Without extensive
        research and brute-force, you are completely isolated from the host
        system's bootloader, root directory, physical drive partition table and
        data, network configuration, kernel. You will have access to the
        allotted RAM, CPU (and GPU if passed through)and storage pool. This
        could open you up to long term hardware damage. I don't reckon there are
        many exploits out there that can Worst case- your SSD might wear out
        from frequent IO and reinstallations. Not sleeping/killing a VM might
        lead to some issues with host OS suspend/hibernate. Nothing major
        though.</span></p>
    <p style="background-color: black;"><span style="color: white;">B) Bare
        Metal/hardware</span></p>
    <p style="background-color: black;"><span style="color: white;">the levels
        of risk are divided into-</span></p>
    <p style="background-color: black;"><span style="color: white;">Application
        software/high-level</span></p>
    <p style="background-color: black;"><span style="color: white;">Software
        here is relatively safe. You will get a polkit prompt to run privileged
        operations. Software in the "high-level" category usually has a GUI and
        progress bars. Exceptions are usually handled well and logfiles are
        descriptive. """Apps"""" fall in this category, along with a large
        portion of systemd, and udev, grub/refind, coreutils etc. They usually
        have good documentation, user-friendly APIs and guides in Linux wikis.</span></p>
    <p style="background-color: black;"><span style="color: white;">Changes here
        are mostly temporary and do not persist across reboots(obviously not
        talking about disk modifications, grub configuration etc).</span></p>
    <p style="background-color: black;"><span style="color: white;">Userspace/low-level</span></p>
    <p style="background-color: black;"><span style="color: white;">Software
        here is usually documented and mentions hardware support, usually
        implicit(ideapad_laptop module for example). Modifying disks with
        low-level utilities, EFI system partition creation and modification.
        Documentation for programs have an exiguous existence for some reason,
        and checking various various Linux wikis is the first thing you should
        do. Changing fan speeds, cpu frequency and voltage, talk</span></p>
    <p style="background-color: black;"><span style="color: white;">Hardware</span></p>
    <p style="background-color: black;"><span style="color: white;">This is a
        red zone. Tinkering here includes issuing ACPI calls that are not
        documented and not confirmed to work flawlessly, using completely
        incompatible drivers, etc. You can easily cause hardware damage here. A
        lot of these changes are PERSISTENT across reboots and OSes. Never
        "modify" hardware. There is almost always a better implementation that
        relies on profiles, udev, systemd APIs. Issuing acpi calls to power down
        the discrete gpu when not in hybrid graphics mode, damaging the MUX,
        freezing the OS and sending fans to 100% speed in under a
        second(happened) because of heat. Other examples- not reading the manual
        and issuing APM to unsupported drives causing a full crash and
        corruption of hard drive, modifying undocumented and unsupported
        features of wireless and sound cards, etc. Mistakes here are usually
        because of not heeding several warnings and not using the recommended
        userspace tools. Remember, you want to always be able to have a clean
        slate by rebooting.</span></p>
